# Question

What is the difference between how instance methods/properties and class methods/properties are created? What is the difference between how they are used?

# Answer

Class methods and properties are defined using the static keyword, while instance methods and properties are defined without it. Static methods and properties can only be accessed through the class itself (e.g., ClassName.getAll()), not through an instance of the class. In contrast, instance methods and properties are accessed on an instance of the class (e.g., instanceOfClassName.name). Additionally, instance methods are shared among all instances of the class via the prototype chain, meaning they are not duplicated for each instance but rather referenced from a shared location. Instance properties, on the other hand, are unique to each instance.
